One Page Website with Bootstrap Components
Per the Coding Steps:
1.	Using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript create a single page website that contains the following:
    a.	A Bootstrap styled table representing your choice of data.
    b.	A Bootstrap styled form that allows a user to add a new row to the table when submitted.
        I created a form, but a new row cannot be added.
